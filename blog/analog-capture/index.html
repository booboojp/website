        <h2>digitizing analog video</h2>
        <p>In this blog post I'll be going over how I digitize analog video using a WinTV card, from multiple sources including VHS tapes and game systems.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>required equipment</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Video source (VHS tapes and VCR, game console, etc)
                    <ul>
                        <li>When recording VHS tapes, I use a high quality JVC VCR, but then pass the video through a cheap Funai VCR/DVD recorder combo deck as it has a built in time-base corrector (TBC)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>RCA cables</li>
                <li>Optional - Digital TBC (time-base corrector, you can either use a standalone one, or pass the video through a DVD recorder/VCR combo deck)</li>
                <li>Windows PC
                    <ul><li>I would have liked to use Linux, but sadly the state of recording video on Linux is quite sad at the moment</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Recording software (WinTV software, OBS, etc)</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC media player</a> to view finished videos</li>
                <li>Capture device - I use a WinTV card</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>hardware setup</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure your analog source is properly outputting video by connecting it to a TV or monitor</li>
                <li>Connect the source to the time-base corrector with RCA cables (optional)</li>
                <li>Install the capture device into the PC</li>
                <li>Connect the output of the TBC to the input of the capture device, or if not using a TBC, connect the source directly</li>
                <li>If your TBC has a second output, it may be helpful to connect that to a second monitor for testing and/or lower-latency viewing as capture devices often have significant latency</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>software setup</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install VLC media player as well as the capture software of your preference
                    <ul><li>If you're using a WinTV card, the WinTV software is recommended as it properly configures deinterlacing of the output of the card</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Configure your software to record from your card
                    <ul><li>if you're using the WinTV software, you can right click on the main screen of the program, click on Settings, and go to the channel setup, where you can select S-video and/or composite</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Configure the software to record in the highest quality. WinTV software records in MPEG-2, so the highest quality available should be a little higher than DVD quality.</li>
                <li>Make a test recording using a source you would like to record, and play it back in VLC.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your video appears shaky, you may need to use a TBC.</li>
                        <li>If your video does not have correct colors, you may have selected the wrong video format. The standard video format in the USA is NTSC.</li>
                        <li>If your video appears blurrier than you would expect, you may need to change the resolution. The recommended resolution is 720x480 (anamorphic).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>conclusion</h3>
        <p>This guide should be the easiest way to record high-quality composite capture in a digital format. The WinTV cards generally offer the easiest way to record high-quality analog video, and the software takes all the hassle in configuring for the best quality possible.</p>
        <p>One issue that you may encounter is that the WinTV software records in MPEG-2. While this is a standard video format, many programs do not support it, so you may want to convert to another format. <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">HandBrake</a> is one of the best pieces of software to do this, and it's free and open-source. </p>
