            <dt>Who are you?</dt>
            <dd>I am an aspiring programmer and/or electronics engineer! For more info, visit my <a href="/about">About</a> page.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Why is your website Galaga themed?</dt>
            <dd>I really like Galaga! In my opinion, old video games did more with less; that is to say, they were incredibly fun even with the extremely limited resources. I also think that older games have a certain charm to them that hasn't truly been replicated since around the era of the Nintendo DS.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>What are those little icons at the bottom of your site and where can I get them?</dt>
            <dd>Those are called 88x31 GIFs (although some of mine are actually PNGs). I got them from friends' sites and the 88x31 archive. In the case of the W3C CSS certification, you can get that by verifying your site's CSS <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">here</a> (it's free).</dd>
